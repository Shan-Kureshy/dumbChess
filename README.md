"# dumbChess"
Welcome To my dumbChess. This is a terminal chess game with a working computer opponent using C!
This project was made mainly for the purpose of learning the C language, Not to simply make a chess game. A lot of the things I do in this program could be done easier in C++ using OOP concepts, But this was a great excercise in learning how to program something complicated with a more limited language

Feel free to use any of my code for any purpose (As long as you credit me)
